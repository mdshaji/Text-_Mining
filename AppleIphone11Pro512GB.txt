  This product USED TO BE GOOD earlier; but now it's either fake or a severely downgraded version of what it used to be. This was my second purchase of SB571 and I disliked this new SB571 compared to my earlier one. Here is what I observed suspicious in the new SB571 delivery.1. Box packing is a single, side-opening style. But my earlier delivery had a 2-piece, top opening box.2. The new speaker has charging panel & ON/OFF buttons on back-side TOP, whereas my earlier speaker had it at back-side BOTTOM.3. The manual is in booklet format this time. Whereas the earlier manual was made of a single paper folder several times into a leaflet.4. This time, speaker has sharp edges which literally can hurt you, while last time it had gentle edges5. LED light is different and large but diffuse this time. Earlier LED was small, elegant and looked like 3 LEDs (see pictures).6. New speaker has voice-assistance & says \"Connected\" etc upon connecting. While my earlier speaker only made \"beep\" sounds when connected/disconnected etc.7. This new speaker is not as loud as my previous speaker. Earlier speaker is very loud at 60% volume in phone. I never had to go beyond 60% and going beyond would mean disturbing my neighbors. Whereas, the new speaker is almost inaudible at 60% and almost medium loud at full 100% volume. I have tried increasing volume to full from both speaker and phone. But my previous SB571 is double as loud as the new one.Due to all these differences, I think the new SB571 that I received is either a fake one or a severely downgraded version.

  I have this for over a year now. When I first started using this it was simply the best. Loud sound, Good Bass for such a small unit and a good battery life. There was one small irritant, that if I pair this with more than 1 device and both devices have Bluetooth on, this does a disco of trying to pair with both devices.Now one year later, this device has a severe problem to connect to the laptops. (Phone it connects well). It connects to laptop. beeps, disconnects, pairing mode, connects...beep, disconnect and keep going on.One hack I found around it was that if I put it on charging mode, then switch on and I connect using BT, it connects and works with the laptop, but this takes at least 9-10 tries. Unfortunately, even if I used wired mode, it does not work to have a continuous connection with the device connected and does that disconnect connect beeps.I tried checking for a reset button, but I do not see it on this device. I checked for HELP, but it shows me a user base of other users facing similar problem without proper solution.

  Their is no similarity between the photos and the real speaker. The buttons are not placed at the right positions and soundbot is also not written on the speaker... <U+0001F44E><U+0001F44E>

  Over period of time (since March 2017) I have order 6 units of this speaker.When I first bought it and tried it I was so impressed with the sound that I bought several other units of it and gifted to my loved ones. The sound was crisp, sufficient base for a small room and it was loud enough without any cracking in sound. I was happy.However recently (this month), I ordered it for my brother and decided to check out the sound. The sound quality of this speaker was not even half of the quality of the first speaker that I had ordered in March 2017. Thinking that the speaker may be broken I got it replaced. The replacement was again a disappointment. Bad quality with low output. No clarity at all. Besides they don’t do returns. Complete disappointment.I am concluding that soundbot doesn’t make the same speakers that they used to. Don’t go for it. It would be a waste. There are other players in the market.

  This is not the same old SB571. What makes me mad is, they are trying to sell it under the same name. Now i seriously doubt whether they are 6W+6W. I have tested both for music, movies and podcasts and the old speaker shines is all aspect with respect to loudness and clarity.This is a downgrade from my old SB571. I never coming back to this again. Attached img. Upper is new and lower one is old.

  I have used already a soundbot SB571 bluetooth speaker purchased on flipkart .....my previous speaker sound quality and bass is awesome. But this speaker sound quality and bass is bad. Bluetooth connectivity error. This is not a real Soundbot SB571 bluetooth speaker this is fake or duplicate product because the speaker logo is different and on /off button usb port is up but original speaker is in bottom.

  I bought this 

  
SoundBot SB571 12W Bluetooth Speakers









  
  
    
   on Prime day. I was struggling to choose between JBL and this one. For sure, i know JBL is good, but was more attracted to Soundbot primarily for its sound output and more options. My decision was not wrong. It has been two days and i  found this product an absolute value for money and am happy with the sound quality. It is very easy to pair multiple devices, and it is easy to carry around. It has a good range of distance also (I tried at least from 20 feet distance with wall in between and it was perfect). i did not experience any jarring of sound even at high volume. This is sufficient enough to fill a room of 12 x 12 comfortably.Am eager to see how this product functions going forward and how the customer support works.

  Got this on 09-Feb-2017 from the seller \"TigeRetaiL_SLP\", now its no longer responding to charge, bluetooth..nothing. Just a dead brick. That's it?

  Very good speaker. Nice quality sound. Happy with it . I have been using it for 2 years. Works perfectly. Thanks to Amazon I got it in offer price. I also recommended it to my friend after using it for several months. He is also happy with this speaker

  Really couldn't have asked for a better Bluetooth speaker than Soundbot at this price! The deep base is pretty clear and it's great if you're just listening to music or having a small party in your room. I use it almost daily varying from youtube videos to iTunes and it lasts 4 hours plus if you have heavy usage. Charges quickly and although I've not used it for answering calls on my phone, it can do that as well. The overall design is fresh and will not look dated even couple of years later... The red color I ordered looks great on my table and stands out as well. Many people are surprised hearing the price of it and generally will think it's of some big premium brand. Overall I would say if you're in the market for a good speaker then this is definitely the one to go for!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The base is awesome. No other brand provides with 6W+6W speakers for this price. The volume is good. It has got hands free call feature which works flawlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is very fast and is better than JBL Flip.

  It's been a few days I've been using this product. I am amazed for the quality it brings in this price range. Sound is clear, bass is decent , highs and mids are just fine.Battery backup is up-to the mark. I play it every-night for 8-9 hours to listen to binaural beats , usually with delta waves and it does not go off the whole night. When I wake up I turn it off and use for few hours in the noon , and I've not yet experienced it being low on battery. I connect the charger before it's battery is low. All in one , it's one of the best speakers you can buy in this price range that works endlessly on a single charge along with promising sound quality .  Hope this helps. Thank you :)

  Bought this in August 2018.  This is my second unit of the same device, the last one lasted for 1.5 years.Writing this to laud the wonderful customer service I received from Soundbot.  About 20 days before my 6 month warranty was to get expired my unit's power button went bad.  I contacted the customer service without expecting much but to my surprise not only did I receive a response the same day from Soundbot team.  I was directed towards the process of product replacement: within 12 days of first contact, after I sent back the faulty product, I received a brand new unit -  no questions asked.Big thumbs up for Soundbot's customer service, its prompt complaint response and product replacement policies.

  This is an amazing product. I am writing this review after using this product for nearly 2 year. The sound is amazing, connectivity is good, design is super, has no distortion at high sounds and one of the main thing, the battery backup is good.I had to write something about it because even after 2 years my speaker is going strong. I normally set speaker at full volume while setting my phone or laptop value at mid and below 30% respectively. I play this while exercising or while I am at my terrace and just strolling and set it at 70-80% volume of phone, even though the terrace is wide open and I am nearly 30-40 ft away the sound reaches me pretty well.All in all, this is an amazing product and I am very happy with its performance. I will be buying my next speaker from the same company and this time I will go for above 20-30 watt.PS: I bought it for 1700<U+20B9> and I think after 2 years, I have used my full money's worth.

  One of the good bluetooth speakers i have boughtHave been using for six months now.The good things about it are:-1. Good Battery Life - Lasts about 4-5 hours full volume - full charge2. Crystal clear sound - Zero distortion even at full volume3. Decent Base4. Sturdy design , looks nad feels solid too5. adequately loud for outdoor picnics tooCons -1. More bass could be better (But for such small speakers its almost adequate)2. If you connect using aux, it ll still search for bluetooth connection once (annoys initially)Over all a good buy

  Fab product. Awesome voice. Inside and outside too. Though it could not cover more distance outside cz of noise pollution. And the back up with single charge is pretty amazing. You can use it with cable and without also(bluetooth). If you are looking for decent budget speaker, go for it guys. Using it for 1 month. And using intermittently.

  I am using this for now almost 1.5 yrs and today I thought to order for my sister. This is excellent for this price range. Saw some reviews where duplicate product is delivered,so gave snapshot of the original product. The only problem is previously it used to give backup of around 3-4 hrs but now it hardly gives of 1 hr max. Other than that on the basis of durability & sound quality believe me u can fully trust on this one provided u get the original product.

  Awesome Sound. I have purchased three bluetooth speakers till date. 1) Zoook Bluetooth Speaker, 2) Photron P10 but this one is out of the block.Superb. Just go ahead and buy. Awesome for Car Bluetooth Speaker as well. Believe me you won't regret.

  Great build.Amazing sound quality.Bass and Treble is great. I use Poweramp Full Version from play store for <U+20B9>69 .Combine both and you will have an amazing experience.Speaker is loud enough to rock a party or small gatherings.Got it for <U+20B9>1899 inclusive of <U+20B9>100 for One day delivery..Im quite impressed with such great performance at budget friendly range.And thanks to amazon for speedy one day delivery.

  I compared it with my Mi basic 2, even though the Mi is 5W total it had better and louder mids then the soundbot product which claims to use 2*6w speakers. Soundbot does deliver richer bass but it distorts at high volume which is very bad.Bluetooth menu does not show battery %age which tell me that the bluetooth chip soundbot used is a generic audio chip with separate charging controller and is not a fully integrated chip like other high end manufacturer.There is considerable amount of noise at high volumes. Very weaks mids speaker cant be used for media consumption other than Music.P.S. Sorry the images were taken is complete darkness.Update: Just reviewed it with MiVi Roam vs JBL Go.  Both are 3w single speaker units, a lot more portable, sound very good, no distortion (all 3) and louder than this 6w+6w watt unit. It does have a little better bass( but with volume so low how does that even matter.)I have read reviews of earlier unit being good. So This might just be a copy product.I would suggest skip this. Go for MiVi roam I bet you will not regret it.

  This product stopped working after a few months. I claimed warranty at Soundbot customer care, but RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMER CARE WAS VERY PATHETIC. They REPLACED MY DEFECTIVE UNIT WITH ANOTHER DEFECTIVE UNIT and when I again complained about this they did the same again. My product has BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM-it disconnects every now and then and once it DOES NOT CHARGE, DOES NOT TURN ON! You will regret wasting money on this product. Soundbot is not a brand at all, don't go for it!

  Its a magic in such a good price, i got this in 1500 on offer, being using this from past more than 3 months and is really excellent, sound, battery backup everything is just awesome ...But i guess its not the original one or might be soundbot changes the look and feel.Back of the speaker, the On/Off and cable connectors are located in top but actual in video its showing in down, even the same speaker we will get in 750rs also, that too in amazon only, get the link from here .

  Using since December 2017. It was so good for one year. But of late the sound output has gone bad. Like the distortions (only for keen ears) and output that's just.... Well.. ordinary.  . But the speaker not lasting even 2-3 years with the same output quality is a bit sad. It feels like any other regular speaker and lacks clarity of output, poor resolution of details and mild but annoying distortion from the speakers- all after one year of use.The degrading quality over time isn't at acceptable levels. Was expecting atleast 2-3 years of listening. Battery is good though.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It is really bad news that my device which was working fine till a week ago stopped working suddenly and it doesn't even get charged. When i tried to get a replacement under warranty from Sound Bot they said that the reseller Viket Solutions is not their authorised reseller. This is actually rediculous since the buyer needs to do lot of background checking before buying on Amazon.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have owned this device. When i bought it I liked it for its design and sound felt ok at below maximum levels though my friends never liked this one bit. After couple of months the battery started to degrade. It was giving lower uptimes. So I charged it often. Once it dint start at all and that was it. I removed the back rubber casing there were two slots that can be opened in one such slot a saw something like plastic sheets wrapped in the size of old nokia phone battery. It dint had much of a protection of its own. I went on to remove the rest of the screws to arrive at the cause of the issue. The board was shorted probably because of overcharging. Now im not an expert in portable speakers. But if you combine a high wattage speaker with a low capacity battery we will end up charging it more often. With a battery like this and if the person listens to music regulalry it could end up losing its charging capacity in a couple of months. The sound aint that good too.

  Exactly the same issues I am facing. This product has lost the sound quality and the loudness with which It was delivered. Even with the loudest volume, one has to dig in the ears towards this set to understand the sound. Also the Bluetooth connectivity issue is very sever as it keeps connecting and disconnecting with my laptop Bluetooth. It keeps jumping from my laptop to my iPhone and vice versa. One hack I found around it was that if I put it on charging mode, then switch on and I connect using BT, it connects and works with the laptop, but this takes at least 9-10 tries. it has become useless and irritating device.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have been using this for more than 1 year and not a single problem. The sound is really good and even you can feel the bass.  EDIT:- 15-Sep-2018 18 months after buying  Right now I'm facing a problem with Bluetooth when it just connects and disconnects frequently and even the aux port is broken (I think  solder points got weak from the circuit board ).  And I can say the battery backup is very much decreased what it used to be.  Before this, I had another one for my father which is still working smooth, no issue after using that I got another one for me.  I can say the quality is getting low year by year.

  Sound quality is good not the best. I got it around 999<U+20B9>. This Bluetooth speaker is having one bug like it connect with multiple device at a time which ultimately create nuisance while playing. Otherwise it is okey. The sound quality is 5/5. Bass 4/5,  Treble 5/5, overall 3.5/5. It has an aux connectivity optionb 3.5mm cable given in box. Handsfree option is there so call can be made or answer in loudspeaker mode. This is little old in 2019. Carefull with duplicate one buy from original amazon seller like cloudtell/aparioretail.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Considering the price its not a bad deal at all. However, after reading all the good reviews I was expecting a little better bass.The overall volume isnt an issue, but bass seems less. Overall the sound is a little tinny (treble heavy). In short a little warmer sound would make it apt.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have tried a lot of bluetooth speakers including the zook rocker and the likes but none of them come close to the sound quality of this one! It may not be as loud as a lot of other LOUD speakers but it is loud enough to play indoors and even outdoors. The sound quality is really amazing at this price point. Bass lovers might not find it very pleasing but for the rest of us who like to listen to each and every detail in the music this is perfect!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I don't often write reviews but this awesome speaker forced me to write one. This is a tiny little speaker, almost as big as my one plus 3 in width but produces astounding sound. Not boom base but you can definitely feel the beats. Good sound clarity and awesome Bluetooth reception.  Just for comparison, I own a jbl force 2 and this one blows jbl out of water.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  it's not good product there is many problems likeSound quality was not goodBase was also badBluetooth connectivity was goodafter using 6 month Power button was not working...so I complained to customer care..and he said to send speaker at this address and I do that.... after 1 month he said youy speaker parts are not available...so I refund money and after that he refund only 250<U+20B9>..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have been using it for 1 month and it has been great. Amazon delivery wasn't that goodbut I'll give 5 stars for the speakerBass is great and sound is also amazing but ill recommend not to play the speaker while charging as its sound get low while charging, other than that its battery is also good.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I ordered this product twice---- once in 2017 and once this year. The difference is immediately noticeable. The newer product has a nicer finish but the quality of output in sound is immediately apparent. The older model was way more loud had clear and crisp sound and had better battery backup. The newer one just looks nice but has worse sound output than the older product and even mi basic 2. Strictly a no buy.

  Using since more than a year. Durable, good battery life and what a sound quality and bass. It will easily shake your hiuse party. Thankyou amazon and soundbot for addin life to our parties and groves our PGs. Fristly was hesitate to buy a unknown brand, but what a execellent piece. Thank you so much. Reasonable than other highend brand and sound quality is more than these brand.

  Best bt speaker at low price has very good sound quality than other <U+0001F50A> available at this price if anyone asks me to what type of speaker should they buy i will definitely suggest sound bot,the same was the suggestion given to me by my friend<U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A>

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Major positive reviews posted earlier found correct. Bass is very good.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I just love this product. While on Bluetooth, it's pretty good and loud enough. It has it's own volume too! Just one concern that while on aux, it takes away the pleasure of listening through it. The sound is very bad through aux. So, i think aux is there just for namesake and adding to the features.Otherwise, all other features are upto mark.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Though I was fairly happy with the sound output given the speaker's size and price, I was in a for a shock after using it for 2 days, when suddenly it started showing connectivity problems. When you turn on the speaker the vice prompt says it's connected , but when you try to play music on it it doesn't. Neither any sound comes out of the primary device you are using to play the music. And the most annoying part is when the voice prompt just goes on repeating that the device is connected every 10 seconds or so. Though I didnt wish to go through the hassle of returning the product and buying a new one, I had to because to have a device that stats malfunctioning withing 2-3 days of purchase is simply unacceptable. Sound wise it produces good treble and acoustics. Listening to soft instrumental music and vocal heavy numbers on it is pleasurable. Had it not been the connectivity issue I would have given the product a good rating.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  DO NOT BUY IT AFTER WATCHING THE GREAT REVIEWS ON YOUTUBEThe model being sold here is different from the one which is being reviewed.The (US version) of this product is good, but they are selling a lower quality version specially made for Indian market to keep the price low.Sound quality as well as Battery backup both are bad compared to actual product.There is no reason to buy this and not buy any other chienese speaker costing 400-500.

  Received two USB cables instead of one 3.5 mm audio cable and the other USB charging cable however the product was sealed pack. BTW I got compensation for the same. Thanks to Amazon for its exceptional support.

"









  
  
    
  Not working exactly after one year. When i approached the service center they are charging too high just simply for Rs.1400 speaker. request you to buy some other good brand speakers.courier - 100 rupees, though courier people change 40 to 60 rupees they take 100 rupeesspare - 150 rupeesservice charge - 250 rupeesGST - 50 rupees

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The sound quality is amazing. BUT MY SPEAKER JUST FAILED TO CONNECT TO ANY OF MY DEVICES ONE FINE DAY FOR NO REASON. I contacted Amazon and Soundbot team, but since it's been more than a year, they couldn't help me with anything. I would NOT recommend buying this device as initially it would work fine, but later it'll mysteriously stop functioning and you'll get no support from anyone; and you'll lose your money for no reason at all.

"









  
  
    
  Battery drains out within half an hour...not as expected. Have been using  from 4 months, though battery wouldn't last....stopped working since then...I think the company had sent rejected product....or cheap quality battery has been used....when applied  for replacements  under warranty... They asked for 195/- shipping charges...so, l paid 250/- to the locals & got it repaired. Now working fine.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It turns off abruptly while playing. Have tried connecting the speaker to a source via the aux socket using a stereo audio cable but same thing happens. With Bluetooth connection also, it stops playing all of a sudden. Purchased it on 10th Aug'17. Need warranty service but not able to trace an authorized service center. Very poor product & service.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Battery swelled up and died. Prior to this, Bluetooth had intermittent connectivity issues.Sound quality is top notch, loud, and the bass is rich for a speaker of this size.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Don't buy this product at all. It started doing problem in just 3 month of purchase. N one important thing soundbot india has only one service center in India in Bangalore . So if you live in Delhi or any city apart from Bangalore you will have to go to Bangalore or send product by courier service in both case you will be charged i paid 200 to soundbot to pick my speaker from Noida n after one month they sent back my speaker unrepaired. It means there is no free service in warranty period.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The sound volume is very high. However if u play low quality specs, it justs destroys it. For high quality sounf, u  hear every instrument in the song. Great buy at 1600 rs. The logitech speakers modify the low quality sound to soothe your ears. If i had the budget, i would have bought logitech

"









  
  
    
  I previously owned SB571.This speaker i just bought looks and sound like cheap Chinese knock off you buy in lot on Alibaba.Seems like Appario retail bought huge lots of this fake SoundBot SB571 and trying to sell it fast.No wonder it was on Sale for 999<U+20B9> for 10 straight days and sadly i fell for it.Coming to pros and cons..Pros: NoneCons: Low volume than original.  Bulkier and heavy than original.  Voice breaks on high volume which is not a problem in original.If you want to buy original SB571 which is perfect speaker and even better than JBL and other brand speakers in this segment.Buy it from original SoundBot website.Returned and Refunded in one day. Thank you Amazon.

"









  
  
    
  This is a compact and powerfull Bluetooth speaker. I love everything about it, except for the on/off switch. I have used it for a year and now it's just a matter of luck to turn the device on. Sometimes the button works and at others it doesn't.I'm no audiophile. But the sound quality is good, gets reasonably loud without any distortion and has good battery life.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  When I first used this speaker it was simply the best. Now it's been 7-8 months and there is so much of problems connecting to this device. Even after full charge it would beep while playing music. The proximity of connection too has decreased. I have heard that if you send this to a service center then you have to pay extra money for pick up and drop off.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Yeah its a better product in this price range.Im writing this review after 3 months of usage.I had many expectations while purchasing this product as it got 1.2k 5star reviews.The sound is amazing and good backup its a real little beast but now the aux is not working with it im really disappointed

  
"

  Good quality product and regarding authenticity of product I got confirmation email from company...Same has been attached.It's generation 3 product and there are some modifications.... I got clarification from company.... Totally satisfied.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I was confused whether to buy this product or not and eventually ordered this sound box , when I opened the product I was little disappointed looking at the size of the speaker which was close to 6 to 8 inch in length but when I started playing the music I was satisfied. however I was looking for more high capacity speaker but even this item is not less than good for a 1BHK apartment. Happy with the item!

  My second speaker. First one quit working after two year. Few changes in new one like location of charging port, on off switch etc. Sound enabled low battery notification (which I don't like).Sound quality is super....

  got this speaker through lighting deal at <U+20B9>1599... good bass... sounds well.. good battery life... nice connectivity... utlimate built quality.. trust me... go for it... all the best

  It's been 1 year since I've been using SoundBot SB571. My usage is mostly 3-4 hours on an average, daily basis.Initially, it has performed well for few months. Once charged, battery would run for 2 days. Now I've to charge it 3-4 times a day since it would run barely 1 hour per charging.As far as sound quality is concerned, its decent, not amazing at all.Anybody who's considering to buy this speaker & intending to use it for long term, PLEASE DON'T.

SoundBot SB571 Bluetooth Speaker 12W Output HD Bass 40mm Dual Driver Portable Speakerphone"

  Bought the speakers around a year ago. Worked fine in the beginning, after a few months problems started to occur. The sound would crack, bluetooth connectivity randomly lost, battery malfunctioned. Contacted customer care and they said I can't avail the warranty since I didn't buy it from an authorized amazon seller. Take the advice, spend a few more bucks and get a decent one from a reputed brand. Because at the end even this would be a waste.

  I am lucky that i ordered this product,i didnt know about the brand , i bought it because i seen this product in my friends uses. I have been using it in a month and i have very positive review of this product. sound quality is excellent at full volume it distort a little bit ,overall most of all don\"t even notice it.  battery life is excellent and i think i am getting more than what company says. its small in size and easily get into bags for packing .pairing is very easy i use this it with pc , mobile and even while i play guitar(connected with AUX cable).I think its a best all rounder speakers.

  Editing my review after very bad experience with Soundbot.I will never suggest anyone to buy SOUNDBOT PRODUCT.After getting my faulty unit replaced by sending twice to service center and receiving once an old and damaged piece, the unit I received now is not connecting properly with computer bluetooth. Getting disconnected continuously. The same problem was with my original purchased one when I sent it for replacement.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I should say its a decent budget speaker, but the sound quality didn;t raise to my expectations really.. I felt that the loudest volume was nothing more than a mid-range sound. But the bass is OK, nothing great on that too. I heard from many that this speaker used to be better before, and I guess that's true, as my friend has aa awesome version of the same speaker that he bought a year back. I bought this one because of that. But as of now, I wouldn't really recommend it.

  Low Price.....High Power Sound......Minor Distortion In Sound In High Volume....Slight Issue in Bluetooth Connection......Gradually Decreasing Battery Capacity..... Duration of Playing Time.....

  I am writing this review after using this stuff after one year and couple of months...Not worth this price.JBL is better if have to pay extraSound is okayI have a small jbl speaker as wellIt's been 2 years and still workingBut this one is like pain in the ass..So neutral

  
"
"









  
  
    
  ProsSmall compact size.  So easy to carry.Good audio.ConsThere should be an alert when the charge is down so that we can charge it before it drains fully.  This alert is missing.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Cant compare with others since i never listen to any.But this one is absolutely stunning as per the sound quality and bass is also good.May be not perfect because of the missing battery indicator.After 1 day usage : Video audio synchronisation is not there.In phone it is running fine but no sync but in laptop video cant play.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I got it for Rs.999/-, still working smoothly. No connectivity issue or issue related battery backup experienced till date. Sound clarity is also good, not disappointed as I was not expecting much bass as in case of costly premium speakers.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The best Bluetooth Speaker at unbeatable price!Positves :1.Quality,bass, sound clarity everything superb..2. You can attend calls, connect two phones at a time3. Easy to carry, easy to charge via USB cable4. Can be used in cars for music, to attend calls and for picnic as well.5. The best one at best ever price.It's been 5 months Iam using it, no problem at all.. !!!!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  After using it for almost 3 years the speaker is absolutely amazing. The sound and ease of connectivity and portability are all outstanding.Better than the famed speakers around.Buy it if you want peace of mind. Perfect product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  i have changed my opinion. This speaker after using for 6-8 months, lost its ability to give out sound. I have contacted with the manufacturing company, they say that the order is not purchased from authorized sellers. Then i don't understand, how this product is getting displayed on amazon. Worst product and worst customer service.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Looks great reasonable rate of rs 900 . But when comes to sound base is much higher. Not clear. Speaker looks large in image but while deliver it was very small. Not as much expected from soundbot. Better to buy 572 mobel from sound it was  quite good compared to this speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Those speaker sound quality is good and worth the cost, but when the charge is low the volume is very low. Also I am not sure how to disable the wireless feature when i don't need it. Wireless range is also good. Mic is also included for mobile calls.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This one is a mini beast. I have been using beats pill before this and trust me this one is better than pill. The sound is very loud and clear and enough to fill one big hall, You can feel the bass as well. I also got extended warranty of 18 months free of cost and that is very handy. All in all a perfect budget speaker. Only con is that it is not water proof / dust proof as given by other brands

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The battery seems to have stopped holding charge any more. I bought this not a long time back but now, the speaker doesn't hold charge regardless of it being used or not. It takes 12 hours to charge and after 1 use it stops working if I reboot it 3 days later. My friend recommended this speaker and his is till in top condition. I cannot underatnd the degradation in quality.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I don't know where to begin. This product is way better than I expected. I mean, for this price it has so much clarity in audio , be it music or movies or documentaries, it's all crystal clear. Don't expect mind blowing bass out of this but it is all well balanced. I currently have bose soundlink 2, B&O play, sony sbs and marshall but these are expensive brands. This little guy can easily match up to the big players. I'm happy with it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after using for 3+ months. Definitely worth a buy at this price. Getting awesome playtime (more than 15hrs) on a single charge. If you are really not into heavy bass stuff but need clear sound with decent bass, then please go for this one and i can tell that you won't regret it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Writing the review after using for 1year.The speaker is good for a single room. Bass is not so much. Those who love more bass should not go for this.The Bluetooth range could have been better. its works perfectly only if the phone is within the same room.Beeping sound on when max volume is reached iritates sometime. Not suitable for outdoors as the volume is not so high.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The Best Bluetooth speaker. It's my first and it's still with me, everyday min 3 hrs I use it. I bought it 3yrs ago. There is no problem at all with Android phone but have to try few times to connect my PC. 12W speaker is a monster, my friends like it very much whenever we hangout. Must buy, don't know they are still retaining their originality.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Value for money. Very loud.Bass is okiesh.Small and lightweight.No FM or card reader though.Update:Speaker had an issue after 11 months into warranty period, however issue was very promptly resolved and a repaired unit was delivered by Soundbot India customer care team(care@soundbot.in)Really appreciate the genuine and quick support!!!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I bought this product under lighting deal for 1600, the product is worth the price and in absolutely great in sound quality. 100% satisfied

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I didn't liked it..the sound quality is good but volume is too low..I wanted to return it but the return system is so complicated in Amazon that by the time I understood the process the window to return the item was closed. Amazon should be more clear about how we can cancel or replace the product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The speaker audio quality is good however it is not reliable. Within a month from purchase the speaker stopped working. We contacted the soundbite team. We were asked to deposit <U+20B9>195 for replacement. This was on 23 Rd August and I am still waiting for the replacement.So finally they picked it up and now it's more than a month and we are still waiting for the replacement.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Excellent value for money , dont kniw y the negative reviews. You cant compare these to the jbl or etc,. Coz its one fourth price, it does the job fpr you , its quite loud, it plays all needed bits of a song, i habe been using it since 1 n half year !Go for it blindly if u dont wana experiment on expensive speakers. Bang for the buck.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Sound quality best, bass quality also best at it's price range but it behave like a dead brick, Bluetooth connectivity not so up to the mark, power button sometimes doesn't work properly, then you have to restart again and again. Battery quality also good. If you handle with care then it is the value for money product for you.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Best Speaker in that Price Range.I was very hesitant while buying the product, but bought it anyway. After 7 months of use, I am writing this review.Believe me, it is a beast at that price range.It stopped working after 7 months, I filed a complaint at Instaplay (Service Center for Sounbot in India) and they have replaced the product.I will buy it again if need be.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Nice product. Amazon delivery was very nice and before time. Sound is not the best if i say so... Cz there's a lot of high end speakers on market e.g. JBL, BOSE etc. But as per as the concern remains it's perfect at what i owed the company for it.Yes! You can go ahead and buy it for your entertainment.Hassle free to carry with you.Sturdy, Looks great, nice equalization of High, Mid, and low(Bass, treble, midi).

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Pros.- design well built- multiple connectivity options- crisp sound- multiple buttons for changing the trackCons- once you max out the volume the quality of sound decreases and distorted noise is audible sometimes- bass is not that good compared to other portable speakers out there- battery backup upto 1.5-2hours

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It's not even been a month since I got it and it has already started creating a lot of issues. The voice is distorting like anything at high volumes and now there are severe problems in pairing it with a new device. Also using the Device by 3.5 mm properly is pretty much impossible unless the battery is completely drained out,

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have tried a few Bluetooth speakers and this one actually did surprise me for the price I paid. No wonder this product is so highly rated. Deep bass, and crisp sound effects. I wish this had a remote control option too.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  When opened package, thought that the speaker was too small and couldnt deliver high sound and base. But to my surprise and my roomies surprise, it was boombastic. Go for it. Do not have a second thought. I bought it for Rs. 1,883/- but you could wait it as it is almost around Rs.1,750/- and the best price for the product was Rs. 1,599/- bought by my friend in Amazon.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is great for the priceSomebody they are saying it is fake absolutely it is not trueIt is new upgrade virsion of old oneSo don't get confusedIt is really have a great quality bass and has great sound quality.Just go for it better than jbl

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Works great. The volume and bass are on point. Have been using it without any problems for over 6 months now. Pretty good product for speakers in this price range.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  For 3 months it was a superb quality product. Very good battery, great detailed sound and very handy to carry. Friendly to pair with all devices but unfortunately it stopped working after 1 year, Doe get charging but does not turn on at all and not at all repairable so 2000 bucks gone waste in just a year.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  When I bought this speaker it came with 2000 mah battery and I came to know that it comes with 1000mah only I have no idea about,  Backup was quite good but when we turn the volume at higher level, the sound gets started cracking up and not have loud in sound. And if I talk about the Bluetooth connectivity range, it works within a room only.I think I had been provided a duplicate speaker.....

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I love battery and bass of this speaker .. it is loud enough to fill a house . The only thing is that the clarity is sometimes compromised ..My old speaker was \"magic Box\" which I got it from USA. Which almost look similar to this speaker. But the clarity and drumbeats of magic Box speaker were awesome.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Sound quality is good but volume increase/decrease function is pathetic it stops the audio when you do that. Connectio n range is pretty good but it will stops audio for a while when connection is successful.No inbuilt fm player is the big concern.All over a good sound quality product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Amazing sound quality for such a small speaker. They must have torn apart a Bose and copied it. Bluetooth connectivity is a bit annoying, with an automated voice.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It's a highly recommended portable speaker. It has badass bass and the sound is quite clear at high volume. Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity is sketchy, but I found it has more to do with the phone than the speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I could not give less than 1. This is a very unreliable company. Within 3 months it stopped working. There are many good companies out there in this price range, go for them than that...

  
"
"









  
  
    
  After much research  I bought this product. And I must say I am beyond satisfied. It has top class sound quality as well as battery backup. The design is cool and sturdy. It has fallen many times by me but it works just as pleasant. I would insist you all buy this even if you don't need a speaker. You'll thank me later!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Excellent bluetooth speakers for 1800. :)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This was my 2nd Time buy the same speaker after 2017, the quality of the speaker has gone done soo much i can't believe it. The New Model or First Copy or Downgrade of the Speaker is soo bad.The sound is not even 50% of the original speaker i bought in  2017. The packaging is also gotten cheap your get the speaker in a paper box instead of those cardboard box, the whole speaker is made of plastic with sharp edges instead of the Smooth rubber matte finish which was in the earlier models. The price of the speaker should be 500rs. Shame on you SOUNDBOT for you have gotten your quality standards soo low. This is yet another cheap chinese made speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  3 days usage says that the 5 star reviews here are all the real satisified customers...but if they had included FM n MEMORY CARD it would have been a much more great effort from soundbot...nice undistorted ,room filling sound...thank u amazon for the 100% perfect hazzle free,peacefull courier service...i give u whole heartedly 6 stars for ur service

  
"
"









  
  
    
  First off-all thank you Sound booth for this excellent budget Bluetooth speaker. It's just awesome sound in this range and very handy. Much much better than others Bluetooth speakers (in the range of Rs.1000- Rs.3000), in terms of price, sound quality etc. Thank you Amazon for excellent services.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Awesome... It looks Mini but it's a blast packed in an elegant size of a bluetooth speaker. The sound is clear and deep. You can't believe until u hear it's performance. so go for it and you would not regret this buy.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It's really good as compare to the specs and price range but at some points it's lacking. Earlier also i have purchased the same product, now built quality is different. I have seen issues with the charging port and sometimes in connectivity.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It seems to be a duplicate copy of sound bot, I purchased the same product earlier but that is far better than this in sound quality, maximum volume and battery lifeThere might be some problem with this particular piece, I want a replacement of this speaker

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This speaker was full of surprises. Probably coz I had low expectations. I got this for 1500/-.It's loud for it's small size and has pretty good bass. Bluetooth connectivity is good for a 1BHK.Call quality was also better. I was clear and audible at the other end.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product is ok but one big drawback is they dont have any operating service centre. each time you have to courier it to bangalore and pay 200 for it(this is valid even for inspection)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Good speaker in this price range,build quality: 3.5/5Loudness: 4.5/5Bass: 4/5Sound clarity: 4/5Battery backup: 3.7/5

  
"
"









  
  
    
  One of the best speakers, i have came across in recent times. Sound quality is too good. Battery life is a bit less than what is claimed.The first product which i got was faulty (Battery i guess), but the support for the replacement was very smooth and it happened in a week's time. So, i am very happy to be able to use this product again :).

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I've been using it for a few days now and I'm thoroughly impressed with the performance. The speaker i received didn't have the SoundBot logo on the back and at first i suspected it to be a fake, but after using it, i found the sound quality to be fantastic, so the lack of a logo doesn't bother me. The volume is extremely loud, great bass. The sounds are crisp and pleasant. I doubt anybody who buys this product will be disappointed.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Excellent ! Was not expecting that sound quality would be this good. BASS is too good and you can feel the vibrations if the speaker is placed close to you. The only \"use case\" that I had in mind when ordering this speaker was to listen to some soft music while \"working from home\".  Now the day itself starts with music on this speaker. Very happy with the purchase :)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  First batch of production was designed with best quality sound with less battery life.. but the one i bought 4 months before is having unclear sound at top volume. First batch was having clear suberp sound at top volume

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Have been using this speaker for more than year now. It has good sound output with good quality drivers. The battery lasts for roughly 6 Hrs on full volume and the clarity is pretty decent for this price.. definitely recommended!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  i bought this product some time back and after few days i got the buzzing sound even with 75% volume.later few days battery is gone and now its not working at all.. Also bluetooth connectivity would surface and device will not work ..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  A real value for money... great product. Then I seen the SB520 model... alas I wish if I could upgrade my SB571...  for 1000 more bucks. hey cloudtail can u please exchange to to upgrade the product? mine is still box pack condition though using it. n m happy with the product. Thanks SoundBot for a real nice product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  One of the best portable speakers I have listened to. The sound is pretty loud and stays clear at high volumes too. Deeper bass than many on this price point. Battery runs really long. Not made of cheap plastic. Good quality buttons. In short, Totally worth it!

  After 1 year i‘m giving this review. This product is excellent but gets connectivity issues. Also, the  usb socket to charge becomes loose.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  China made product sound quality is not good comparison with orignal soundbot speaker.Don't buy I am going to return it. If any one having confusion contact me 7827773738

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product quality has been reduced drastically. I am having same product bought in 2016 and in comparison to that quality has been reduced. There is nothing left cristal clear sound and bass is pathetic. In competitive market quality assurance is more exist.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I bought the product 6 months back.  After use of 2 months product stopped working.  When I put it on a charge, the red light showed for10 sec and then it goes off automatically.  If you power-on the device it does not start. There is no clue what's wrong. There is no documentation or support to fix it out.  Any guidence on this?

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This speaker has a main issue that the voice is breaking and sound volume is very less compared to old one , I have ordered these speakers more than 2 times , but this time it's not up to the mark , so please it's a kind request that if the return policy is still valid please return the product with the new one. I would be really thankful . Please do it

  
"
"









  
  
    
  this is my favourite product and one of my best purchases at amazon. The quality of sound is excellent and the prettiest this is that it is portable. I can carry it anywhere. Just go for it

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Just received my Soundbot Sb571 Bluetooth speaker. It's awesome for the price. Sound quality is good and bass is decent for the price. Purchased it for 1700 odd Rupees. Only reason I am giving one <U+0001F31F> less is because it's made in China. Other wise it deserves 5 stars. Will review it a month later

  
"
"









  
  
    
  FAKE! THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING FOOL OF YOUR GUYZ! BEWARE. MY SOUNDBOT SB571 SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING RECENTLY AND IT'S STILL UNDER WARRANTY AMD WHEN I CONTACTED SOUNDBOT THROUGH EMAIL AS IT WAS UNDER MANUFACTURER WARRANTY, THEY DENIED SAYING THAT THE PRODUCT YOU PURCHASED IS FAKE SND YOU SHOULD CONTACT AMAZON! A BIG BLUNDER WHAT IT IS!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is the best speaker. Amazing sound quality. Even on higher volume the sound is perfect. Has a huge range for higher decibels. Easy to connect through Bluetooth or cable.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Worst speaker, i have got this speaker replaced 3 times, every unit has battery problem after using just 1 month the battery backup is just 5 minutes. Now it started making loud beep noises and automatically shut down everytime a high note come in a song.. So dissappointing with this speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Best in Class sound output in it's category. Bass is good. No distortions till 90% volume. sometimes the distortion is negligible even at full volume. Good battery backup. A must buy for people looking to buy a portable bluetooth speaker with a budget of around 1500. Go for it. You won't regret your purchase.

  
"
"
   Fabulous sound quality.Powerful bass.Perfect build quality.Awesome durability.Always value for money.The noise level is really high and cristal clear.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It's a beast.. True sound.. Bass is amazing and also the sound quality and battery life is too good. Connection is also very strong and sound clearity is mind blowing. It's better than JBL and Other companies. There customer support and Service center services a excellent too.. I just love this Micro powered beast !!!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Have been using this for the past 7 months and it still works without any disfunction just like new.-crisp sound-its actually loud compared to its size-battery backup is fine-Easy connection(bluetooth and cable)-now u don't hesitate to buy it; just go for it

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Fills the sound stage very nicely.Bass is good. Treble is decent.No complains regarding price.Battery is okay but charges relatively fast.You get what you pay for.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This speaker is awesome and I m using it since 8 months and I am glad to recommend this  speaker. Service also is very good as I have replaced by contacting volcus and instaplay with in a month. Great service for the product has been provided.Thanks to instaplay and volcus for their support.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bought the product recently. One of the best speakers that I have heard in recent years! The packaging, sleek design, and the sound quality are marvelous! Going by the overall quality of the product, I presume, the battery life and durabilty will also be quite good. Definitely worth buying!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Likes-Can't get better speaker at this price.It has good bass (dham dham one), so bass lover can buy it.Sound clearly is good at this range.Its Range is also appreciable.Build qualite durable.DislikesSometime it lags (skips few word or lines of song while playing).If u connect it with more then one device it may switch its prefer and connect with recently connected device.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  nice product, Tested on different soundtrack, classical, Bollywood, instrumental etc.I like the sound quality, Mid range Bass , can connect multiple device.Calling feature also good.Over all value for money.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  not as good as it is hyped to be. Clarity is not 'crystal clear' as advertised. Not water-proof at all. Water reaches the motherboard through the charging / line-in vents. Had to trash it within 1 month. Good only for indoor uses or sunny outdoors.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Purchased them twice Once back in 2016 ending and they were amazing  but they got stolen. Again purchased in Nov 2017 and believe me they are the charm. Had some problem with the product recently so contacted CC and they gave me a new product in a short period of time.Highly recommended but make sure the product is original as some selllers are sending fake products.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product build quality looked fragile. sound quality very poor. no bass at low volume and at high bass sound is distorted. It seems this product is sponsored and reviews are FAKE. No one will ever rate this so high. Not at all recommend.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Sound quality is very bad. After getting the product I checked and decided to return as the sounds breaks. But there is no option to return. Strange. I don't want to again go into replacing etc. I wanted return but no option. There should be option to return and refund.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Loudness personified!! Quality of sound is very good. Other aspects are good as well.Edit: There was a problem with bluetooth of the speakers after about 10 months of regular use. I contacted Soundbot customer care and they were prompt in offering me replacement of the product. Highly recommend buying from SoundBot.

  
"
"
   Got the upgraded versionAwesome product must buyWorth itThe sound quality is good as compared to the old one and the battery life is even better and the best quality bass

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Awesome sound quality. Never had heard of the company name - but with 3K reviews, I thought  - sure it must be good. It did not let me down with over a week of usage .. great stuff.  Clarity of sound is awesome. Pretty loud for a house.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Soundbot SB571 I nearly used it for a year and it still works absolutely fine and sound is very loud and Bass too due to Two speakers. Customer Service also very nice as my product got replacement before a month. Build Quality is Stunning and Easily controllable and I loved this Product so much. I recommend it to buy :)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This speaker was great but not for long, Just after less than 3 months of use the left side of the speaker has started to give a jarring sound when it starts playing which is unacceptable, I would really like to get a replacement cuz it's under warranty but have no way to contact the buyer, Waste of money !

  
"

  The actual product is very good but the one I received was different or fake from the original, the Soundbot logo was different and the max volume was very low compared to the original ones. So requested for replacement and the replaced piece is the same different fake one again  and has lower sound quality than the previous, the replaced piece is worse than the previous fake one. I think it's a problem with the seller, the original speakers are awesome.

  Been 1 n half year m using this speaker ,there is no problem at all .It's sound quality is awesome and it's base quality is really good. Battery life is good. It's a really good product in cheap price range. I will Recommend this product over JBL or Phillips in this price range. Edm lovers will love this product

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is the second time I am buying the same product. Sound quality and battery life is good.I feel sound not has to add FM also as an add on feature .Worth buying go for itI lost the first one due to miss handling.

  Gr8 speakers with good quality and loudness...superb for indoor use!!!Only drawback is their Bluetooth range very small and never between walls.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Not worth money. Sound quality bad quality. Even Bluetooth connectivity is very very poor. So many quiver sound. No bass. please dont go buy fake reviews.

  
"

  Worth every penny.Loud soundBass is ok , just that it sinks down when the volume is high. So if you could manage it from your music player using an equalizer will do better.Battery percentage is shown in iPhone

  Hai.there .I have purchased (SoundBot SB571 Bluetooth Speakers)on june 3/18 .The speeker is having some trouble with the sound. Its within the warranty Period. To which address should I send it to repair it.. rest everything is perfect.. have small defect  with the sound ...thats all.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Initially it was good but within two months it started to degrade and it stops abruptly in five minutes and then does not give continuous sound output,rather in break.. not worth

  
"
"









  
  
    
  the summary says it all, the set has very substandard sound. Not worth, i bought it as a gift but now i think i made a mistake.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I don't remember the exact reason why I brought this speaker, but this purchase has been great. More than 2 years and still it works without any issues. Sound quality is amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is efficient too.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Very good product . More powerful and clear sound than expected and has a very good range.  I will definitely recommend to buy oneIt comes very good packed.Well done soundbot i am really impressed

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Excellent sound quality, play time is really good. Using since more than 1.6 years. Completely satisfied.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Went for doubt purchase by reading previous reviews.however it is a classy product with Crystal clear audio and an amazing battery backup. Its sound is truly high and clear. Dont think much jst go for it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  only suitable for 10X10 Room as the sound is low as compared to 12w output. It seems 6-8 w output or duplicate

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is the third time I ordered this speaker in last 2 years, this use to be great earlier but this time is is horrible. My phone's original sound is louder and better than this. Worst buy

  
"
"









  
  
    
  really bad producti am using it since last 6 monthsproblems likedistortion on full volumeconnection problemmultiple connection at one timeautomatically switching off are so frequently occuringand no service centre toohate this productgo for boatstone instead

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product delivered befor time.Soundbot 571 is good enough..Crystal clear sound but miss deep bass.its has just casual bass.Cons: playing with aux cable sound is awesom but when played with bluetooth its not upto the marks.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It is the best you can get in this range. Though the sound cracks a lil in extreme vol. But that is avoidable as that can happen in any portable speakers. But overall the design is stylish and the sound quality is extraordinary.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Not worth buying.Worked only for four months.IT stops charging after 30 minutes and music does not play unless its continuously out in charging.What is the procedure or repair or replacement ?

  SoundBot SB571 12 W speaker is good looking and good quality, But I not found SD Memory slot in this speaker. Otherwise its good.

  Pro : Cool design, preety loud, connectivity is great, good battery life.Cons : Kinda heavy side, sharp edges, Small audio loss during max volume notification.

  Two of my friends have same speakers they sound really good. I was quite impressed by it so I ordered one for myself. Unfortunately i discovered after two months that my speaker is duplicate. Please look for for trademark sign on the speaker if its not there then consider it fake.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Just go for it. Bought in Sept-17, still basses out like a brand new product. A good speaker for travelling too. It was a bargain when I got it.Just buy it anyways

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bass is more and highs are controlled. Overall sound is okay but volume could have been enhanced. The pack was delivered in open condition without shrink wrap and there is no product logo at the rear as shown in the picture, which raises a doubt that the product was already used and returned by some one else.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Within a year , battery charge not present more than an hour and a few days ago got disconnected automatically and stops working and had to be restarted every 20 secs

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The Sound Quality is rubbish, the voice is not clear as there is a scrambling sound while the bass is played.I won't recommend this product. Please don't waste your money buying this cheap product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  First when I ordered these Bluetooth speaker, I wasn't sure if it was a right choice or not. But when I actually played music in them, I was shocked!! They are bomb!!! Do buy it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  At 1500-1700 it's great. Above that, better options are available. If you get it around this price take this, if not go for zoook or portronics.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Powerful sound, good battery backup. However, I've already needed to get it replaced once under warranty, because the power button stopped working, and now the replacement randomly switches off while playing music. The only way I can use it is by keeping it connected to a power source. Do not recommend.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Base is decent but sound quality is not upto the mark. A 5 watt portable speaker can produce much louder sound than this. Used Jbl Go, Portronics SoundPot, Portronics Bounce. All these 3 speakers are having good base and loud sound even after having a 5 or below watt speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I am using this speaker over a year. This is worst product after using 6 month it got battery problem then i found out there is only one service center in India which is in Bangalore  i have to pay Rs.195 for courier charge suggested by Soundbot they return after 15 days but problem still persist and now they don't reply the mail

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I love this product.. good sound. great performance. great sound clarity. great battery back up.. everything is great about this product. I would like to buy one more when the sale is on again. :D

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The product is great at this price the sound is clear and loud with descent bass. look is also good ,overall happy with the product and suggest  to go with it if you are looking for speaker at this range.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Never go for this or other 3rd class brands. Be wise, invest money only in reputed brands like JBL, Sony, LG etc.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product has got Bluetooth connection problems sound was okay,waited for 6 days for the replacement,it didn't appear,so I asked for money back

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Not at all working after usage of only 5 days. There is no service provider to repair  this product. Also, the mobile number which was given by Amazon is not a proper one to contact Soundbot distributor.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Product performance is worth 5 stars so far. Excellent product at this price. Sound quality and volume leve is good. But only concern is,  what about warranty if any issue occurs.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Really awesome product... Loudness and bass effect is simply superb.. I didn't expected that much and connectivity also good pretty long range access provided... Finally very much satisfied with the product...

  
"
"









  
  
    
  After couple of months it just behaved like a dead brick. I had to contact customer care and get this replaced. But again same problem persist with new one

  
"
"









  
  
    
  best wireless speaker in 1500 cateogary got this for 1100 second purchase loved it clear sound and good bass + battery life is 8 hrs

  
"
"









  
  
    
  i brought this one year before after using this i feel in this price range this product is best close your eyes and buy if you are looking for good beats and sound...i have 10:12 room and this is perfect for  dancing if you have small house party.......

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The sound quality was good.. I mean decent given the price.  buy the worse part is i didnt use it for a month or two and now its dead.  Cant charge cant operatesimply dead. Its been six months since i bought it so now i Wont suggest it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  worst product ..within 15 days ...not working ..  worst worst worst

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I bought the same speaker about 2 years ago and that time i got original soundbot speaker  but this time i got duplicate (brand logo is different, battery MAH is different and sound is not crisp ) product even after replacement.Amazon must look into this matter.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This thing is bloody good, sound is loud ,not very loud, the quaility and bass of the sound is excellent. Simply go for it, give 5 hours plus battery life at 100 volume.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I m not happy with the product and battery backup is worst maximum 1 hours backup. Don't buy this product

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Amazing sound quality but the Bluetooth connectivity range is very poor. The description says 33 feet but actual range is not more than 1 mtr. Dissatisfied with the range. It is as good as a wired speaker.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I use this to run presentations regularly at work. The sound is pretty loud for its size and in terms on connecting with devices, very easy. A good buy, all in all.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Really good Product,used for about 1 year now,great for indoors,connects easily to any device , range of connectivity not true to whats specified but that not much of a trouble.easy to use sound quality is up to the mark for the price.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Nice product for 1.3k. In comparison to JBL Wireless Go 3w speakers I would say speaker is not as loud as JBL but gives good bass quality. In addition it has extra keys for more control. Build quality is good but bit bulky. Worth it..!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I have been using it since a month. Very nice Product. Sound quality & volume is also good. Easy to use & looks decent.Notice some Lag while changing Tracks, But its ok. You will get used to it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Simply amazing sound quality at this price range. Decent bass too.. Didnt hear any disturbance at high volume too.. Pretty compact and great looking piece.

  It's a fake product. Not original soundbot. Really disappointed. Also the package was already opened.

  Well first of all the best price and best quality at this range.the bass 8/10loudness 8/10design  9/10battery  9/10range of bluetooth 7/10not an expert but just my personal view.guys you wont regret having this.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The output offered by this Bluetooth speaker is commendable ..Bass, Treble and Mid Range are well balanced . Value for money .Anyone would love it and u won't have any complaints ..Cheers guys

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I bought this for my fnd and since that day he is not stopping thanking me enough. The only concern is battery. Do not last more the 1 hr after full charge but the clear sound quality suffice the same.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Good product. Value for money.Sound quality is good .Battery life is good so far . After using 3 and half month.Connectivity is also good . I never felt any problem to connect with other devices so far.Delivery by Amazon is also good .

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I felt the product delivered to me was fake but Soundbot mentioned that they have improved and upgraded the product but when I played music on it I felt sound quality deteriorated as compared to original product.. totally disappointed!! Please go for other products

"









  
  
    
  The product recieved by me was defective.Seal was opened and re-stickedOuter seal was removedSound quality was patheticI could feel something shaking insideSeller: Appario Retail

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Just ok. Sound is loud but bass is not good. Bluetooth doesn't works very often.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  At this price it is one of the best.Simple looks, nice built quality.But there is little problem while making connection with a device, have to off-on for 1/2 times (either device or the speaker), after done connecting everything runs fine. (In my case)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This product is too good, i am use this product before 7 months, I can't see any problems, and good battery backup.So u can buy this product, and u also can check,I am sure u also write same review.Thank u SoundBot.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  At last I got it.... Great product... Excellent sound quality... Everything works... Better bass and crystal clear sound.. Works with apple products also... Really worth for money...good quality matt finished body... Awesome product .....

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The sound quality is not upto the mark. Just music playing does not have high bass.The weirdest thing was it didnt work 5 days after the warranty expired. I would suggest other to go for some other brands like JBL. Or go for some low budget speakers if money is the matter. This had moderate range but has has feature and sound less than a chinese speaker

  
"
"









  
  
    
  For this price good bass and good battery, ON /OFF button is kinda weak. at high volumes it reaches mechanical limit and there is little distortion in sound, but try to keep 2 points less than maximum limit on the speaker, that should be fine. But this electronics, You get what you pay for !!!!!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The product was not up too the marks as it is defective the Bluetooth is very week and it gets connected with tow devices at once which is more irritating.*Good point*Sound wise the product is too good.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Excellent and prompt service by Amazon.The product too is excellent can't ask more than this as it is exactly meeting the specifications mentioned.Hope the product remains durable and lasts for long without any future complaints.Product got delivered before the committed dates....do maintain this kind of service

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Awesome product... Good sound quality... Charge stands for the mentioned period of time... I got it for <U+20B9>1875... Worth the money... Weightless... Easy to carry... Small size.... Good volume...

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Not the best small speaker out there. Connectivity issues aplenty and the 6W speakers lack the loudness. Earlier user of the Soundpot and it's definitely better in terms of battery, sound and connectivity.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Been using two for two months. Battery lasts roughly 7-8 hrs. Sound is amazing for the price. Looks quite sophisticated. And very light weight, very easy to carry.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Guys please never buy sound-bot product, you will till die for warranty and also there is no any registered authorized service center.I bought this one and it was a big blunder of my life for the gadgets mind it.rest is your choice.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is sheer value for money. Buy for a rich experience.Good sound. Detailed music. Long lasting battery.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Best product in the category. Purchased multiple units, best for gifting.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Nice product, handy to carry anywhere. Good sound and once charged lasts for more than 12 hours. A good product for music lovers at any place any time.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bass sounds good...but the treble needs to go up a bit...sometimes the vocal may get lost in the background music, rarely happened with me though...all in all a good buy and certainly worth the money

  
"
"









  
  
    
  compared with BOSE Soundlink mini... :P  finally brought this one and also many more items in the same price of BOSE. ..Perfect for self use as well as gifting

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Absolute Beauty.Amazing sound quality, crystal clear and good battery backup.The only bad thing about the product is the power button location. It should have been on the top.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Rather than investing on cheap Chinese Speakers, this is at any day a better option. It is not so costly, and the quality delivered is up to the mark. The battery life could have been better.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bad product...bluetooth stop workin after use of 3-4daysWaste of money

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Really clear sound, but sometimes may crack on full volume while watching movies with a lot of bass but I won't mind that for a bluetooth speaker.The mic could be a better, but at this price it's a great deal!

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The product is very good in performance,  specially the bass is good...also the sound does not distort except on full volume...overall it is value for money

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is the best Bluetooth speaker in this price point. Sound quality is very nice ' Bass is also very good & satisfactory, Battery backup is almost 6-7 hours ,& it feels premium in hands.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Writing this review after 3 months of use and experience is Just Awesome ! Sound quality is very good.. Bluetooth works flawlessly ! Battery back is decent ! Can play music for 4+ hours continuously ! Overall I am happy with this !

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Worst performence and quality and I didn't expect this type of product delivery and if you continue this type of service you may lose costumer

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I got them for 1499 and its exactly what I expected them to be. For watching movies they're perfectly fine but if you're getting them solely for music then I think you re going to be very dissatisfied even when you consider its price. Anything above 60% volume is just more distortion and less music.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Definitely will not work after 1yrUsb socket will start throwing charging issues

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Boss is not at all good.At very high volume, it cracks a little.Whike adjusting speaker volume buttons, Once volume reaches end it pauses for a second for every press.Sound is loud enough.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  SoundBot is one of the best product in bluetooth speakers on amazon at this price range. Far better than philips and JBL go in both sound and bass

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Worst product ... had already become dead in flat 4 months . Unable to reach to any customer care number or ID even under warranty no one to HELP . This company has no presence and amazon is unwilling to help . Shame I bought this under the influence of amazon . PLEASE DO NOT BUY .. wish could give Zero rating

  
"
"









  
  
    
  this is my first bluetooth speaker. and i love it. super sound quallity. but as read in many reviews battery last for 8- 10 hrs. in my case thats not happening. its only 4 -5 hrs. in maximum sound. so a little bit disappointed.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Unbelievably clear sound, perfect bass, battery life and sturdiness at this price.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Initially...loved the speaker for this price;After 6 months the charger pin for this speaker dint work and later it completely stopped .It doesn't get charged with any other chargers....Very annoying

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Surprisingly good quality and sound. It is loud and excellent value for money. In fact it is better than many branded Bluetooth spkrs. Deserves 5 stars.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  3.7 out of 5Just as everyone here says, it is loud compromising with bass and a little bit of clarity

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The product is good but most of the times it fails to connect to my laptop and phone. When it gets connected the sound usually lags for about 5 sec after. Sound is not more than phillips speaker which you can easily get at 800. Loudness could have been increased. Bass is fine.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This was very nice till this died in 9 to 10 Months after that is is not working at all and there is no service center available in all big city and SoundBot replied very late and ask me for Charge Rs.195 for pickup and get it repaired.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Good product at this price but not great. Sound is okay but can get very loud. Overall seems like a good product.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bought this for my brother after a great deal of researching and reading the comments. The Bluetooth speaker is unbelievably good for its price. It has been stable and works really well and has great bass also.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is no dout that this is the best speaker but after a month ago on max volume it clicks sound and that's annoying so any one know how to reset or fix this it would be appreciated

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Five Stars !!!Just Go for it... SB571 is perfect for 12*12 sqft room..I have been using it since May 2017 and till date no complains..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It stopped working after 3 monthsThen i replaced it as it was under warranty (paying 150rs shipping charges)And the replaced soundbot also stopped working after some days...Fed up with this soundbot

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Fantastic.. No words to describe how good this is  very good one for this price.. Good frequency levels.. Good For EDM and vocals also.. Must have.. will give 100 likes.. Highly recommend.. check for the lightning speed deal..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  My SB571 is an awesome product, using it from last 10 months. Compare to the price range its GREAT DEAL! Sound, Bass, Clarity all are excellent. They got an outstanding customer service team in India.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Its an amazing product at such a price! Was not expecting bass to be that good!You will not be disappointed after buying this!

"









  
  
    
  Amazing product for the money but t sound quality could hav been better can't expect more for the money <U+0001F602>Build quality is goodAt max volume there is slight screeching sound but manageable not an issueOverall the product is good ,go fo it worth the price

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Sound Good... But no bass

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Bass is not upto mark...but still very good at price range.... battery life is also good..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  After full charge, I am just able to use it for 3 hours where as its mentioned as 10Hrs wireless.No worries about the sound and it's quality but charging is a bit concern..

  
"
"









  
  
    
  This is my second Juarez Bluetooth speaker. I so I h love this brand now. Nice features and quality.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  No Doubt the product is good, Good base, good sound. I would have given it 5 stars but the speaker died just after 2 months.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  The bass of the product is not at all upto the mark. After hearing for a while I feel it irritating. Also after buying this product you won't be able to return it and only replacement option is available.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  My SB571 worked awesome for 2 weeks and stopped to even to power on after 2 weeks all of a sudden, without any warning.Breaking my head to  fix it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Nice small and light rectangular speaker. It's powerful and has an impressive sound quality. Completely satisfied with the deal on Amazon.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Sound quality is very good

  
"
"









  
  
    
  First received a non working unit. After replacement, new unit didn't have bass at all. People have written very nice comments about speaker sound system. May be I was unlucky. Initiated refund process. Probably I'll buy JBL or some other brand. I have a speaker envant livefree which I bought in 1400 and has better sound and build quality.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Please guys don't buy this product any more. Earlier it was a good product but now the upgraded version is just trash. They increased its bass but now sound quality worse than any other cheap speaker. Thats why they have reduce its price. I got my new speaker with open seal and accessories.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Not at all loud . I have JBL 3w speaker which is easily louder than this. I don expect the JBL quality but for 12 w output I was expecting more. Tried different quality of sounds n tracks, Still the  same. Maybe my expectations were high;)

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I didn't see the soundbot written at the back of itAnd it's the second time it happened speaker box on itself doesn't came up with the plastic layer on it and i noticedAnd it's charger port and aux input are not located correctly. It seems defective productBut if you talk about the sound and bass are quite good.I want a speaker for a long run which i didn't see in this one.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  It's a nice product ....Sound quality was awesome...But it got mal functioned after 6 months of purchase but the service from Soundbot was excellent ...they have replaced the product with free of cost.Worth to buy it.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Worth for moneyBass : 9.3/10Sub woofer : 10/10 ( without any equalizer)Treble : 8.7/10Mid-range : 9.5/10 (without equalizer)I great product for audiophiles.

  
"
"









  
  
    
  I got this for 1700. So couldn't ask for more, performance is decent. It can give competition to big brands. But if you don't want to compromise go for bose...

  
"
"









  
  
    
  Below average speaker, many times it skips the beat and sometimes it gets switched off automatically even though it is fully charged, no battery level indicator.(overpriced)After 2 years of using and it doesn’t work now, and problems persist since day 1.

  I have used it for last few days it is over My expectations. Sound quality is excellent and bass is very good at this price. Strongly recommend must buy if looking for a speaker under RS.2000.

  Sound and battery backup is really good. U cannot compare this speaker with JBL flip series but trust me u will not be disappointed by this speaker also.

  I've been using this speaker for almost a year. I also have a Boat Rugby speaker which seems to be a lot more better considering the base/mid range/volume.

  This is a beautiful thing! A must have for those who doesn't have stereo in their car. You might need to boost bass a little. High and mig ranges are awesome.

  this speaker is a beast it has all good qualities in it and the bass is very nice. This one is perfect for outdoor and indoor. Battery performance is actualy quite amazing can last upto 8.5 hrs of continuous usage. Definitely go for it. Highly recommend it. Amazing than any other budget portable speakers .

  Just the perfect thing, not too loud, not too feable, balanced bass and CLEAR sound. (-1<U+2605>) for some connections issue. The starting 2-3 seconds of the audio are skipped.

  After using it for 1 week. I'm writing this review. very nice product. Very good bass and sound quality. Only thing is it has no low battery indication and sound cuts at low battery. Rest everything is fine. U can simply go for it.

  I had problem with my Bluetooth speaker, but when I complained the response I received was good. the defective system was replaced with a new piece. I recommend the product.
