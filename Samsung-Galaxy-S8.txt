"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."

"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen. As explicitly explained in the description, there is an image burned into the screen, but it really is barely noticeable (and usually only on a white or light page) and it very easy to get used to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."
"Longer battery life than my previous phone, works great with the wireless chargerA very nice phone (previously had a S5 so a leap in technology ) Also works great with the wireless charger I purchased.

"The Good, The Bad and Some NotesThe Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8\" may be a tad too big for one-handed use. A bit smaller would've resulted in the perfect smartphone size for my own preferences.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: jamesmauricebul..."
"Great valueI purchased a galaxy s8, it came in a slim package and it was wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap. The phone was in perfect condition if it was in a box with everything I wouldn’t have been able to tell the difference between a brand new one and this one. Everything works great.

"Most Advanced Smartphone AvailableWow, Samsung really got it right with S8/S8+.  There is so much more to this phone than the reviews tell.  My battery lasts 3 days with daily use on savings mode.  Screen looks great always at FHD or QHD.  Phone is feature packed to the max.  You can remove all extra apps on unlocked version.  I will take this over other super fast phones, as capabilities win me over.Read full review...Verified purchase: No"
"Samsung S8 G950U is a Good Value for the PriceI ordered this G950U to replace my G900.  It was shipped very quickly and I was able to restore most of apps quickly.  The 64G internal memory is great and the signal performance and battery life are both really good.  I have already put a case and glass on it and have had no issues.  It does have a newer OS then my G900 had.  Took a little bit of a learning curve.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>. I would recommend a phone case, though, a little extra protection will make all the difference.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"

"Wireless charging in a modern fully featured device.Even though an older model than current flagships, Samsung is still upgrading the operating system with most of the newest features.  It's almost like a flagship at half the cost.  I love the edge feature for most used apps, the face recognition, and the NFC payment option.  64 GB is more than I will ever need but I still inserted an SD card so I have tons of space.  Battery life is excellent but maybe the most useful is the wireless charging.  Not having to ever plug it in is great.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: diamond.wireless"

"a very impressive phoneI purchased this for my wife, she is a cell phone addict.  after using this phone for a few weeks, we are both impressed.  Samsung really \"knocked it out of the park\" with this design.  Now I see why the upcoming iphone 8 looks very much like the S8.  The S8's camera is great, it takes fantastic pictures!  The screen is gorgeous, and we both like the blue light reduction option, which is something we didn't expect, so that was an added benefit, that is a feature that our old phones don't offer.  All around, i cant think of one thing to complain about, this is a very impressive product.Nice work Samsung!!!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Good value, Verizon fingerprints are a nuisanceI've had this phone for a couple of weeks and I really like it. The interface features have worked well for me (once I got the hang of them) and the camera is excellent. The only thing that has given me trouble stems from the Verizon origins of this particular phone. There were no hitches in popping in the AT&T sim card, but the voicemail function has been a pain. AT&T had to make some changes in my account on their end, and I've yet to get the one-button direct call to voicemail to work. I have to call my own number and go through the prompts. It's not a huge deal, but it would be nice if it were more convenient.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: icellgreatphone..."

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.

"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.

"Solid Phone for the PriceThe phone is like new despite one minor issue. The volume buttons dont have a distinct click when pressed. Normally wouldn't care but under certain background colors, the screen makes a small glitch when the volume key is pressed. Again, minor, and it doesn't affect any if the working parts elsewhere. Also the top half of the screen looks as if a the previous owner imprint a page on the LED screen. Its only noticeable on white backdrops. And all it is is very faint lines running vertically on the top half of the screen. Again, very minor and doesn't affect any work mechanics.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: emb-phones"

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.

"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion.

"Samsung Supercedes Apple by Giving Consumers Access to What They NeedI did research on the functionality of this phone and its capabilities superseded the price I was charged, based on the technical availability in the current market. This is a superior phone, and the seller was 100% truthful in the description, so I am glad that Ebay has reliable seller ratings as I do not use this purchasing platform very often. I have unhinged an entire appendage of accessibility going back to android based software after using iPhone for several years. Samsung is not an entirely private operation, so the software allows you to create your own personalized experience based on the accompanying hardware and firmware. iPhone software and firmware prevents the user from accessing downstream functionality, and so you feel stuck. I do not accept iPhone's product as an engineer. The only thing bringing iPhone ahead is the social acceptance of their company brought on by the iPod.I have attached a couple photos to demonstrate image quality/software of the camera. The camera features an application with auto exposure(frame rate) and auto focusing.Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Samsung, Android software or Apple.

Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen. As explicitly explained in the description, there is an image burned into the screen, but it really is barely noticeable (and usually only on a white or light page) and it very easy to get used to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion.

"Fine but. . .Very pretty, and seems to function well, pretty intuitive.I'm only a few weeks in.  My complaint is that the other day the phone was knocked off a low chair (only about 6 inches off the ground) onto cement.  It had a small chip in the metal casing.  This was annoying, but not a big deal.  However, the following morning that chip had developed into a small crack across the corner of the screen.  Still not a huge deal, but disappointed with the durability.Needless to say, I just bought a case (something I did without for years with my iPhone.)Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Okay phoneIt's an okay phone. The charger that came with the phone did not work. I had to go out and spend $15 on a new charger to get my phone to charge.

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."

"Unlocked phone, but not factory unlocked.I understand that SM-G950U should be a factory unlocked phone, I just dont understand what T-Mobile has to do with it. Why there still T-Mobile start up screen and T-Mobile apps in the phone that I cannot remove. Should this be a clean version of galaxy S8, the one without any service providers info like AT&T, T-Mobile, others, or am I wrong??Read full review..."
"Pretty excellentPhone arrived in perfect condition, as far as I can tell.

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.

"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion.

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion.

I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.

Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.

"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.

Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen. As explicitly explained in the description, there is an image burned into the screen, but it really is barely noticeable (and usually only on a white or light page) and it very easy to get used to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button.

I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."

"Owner for 4 months now!I went from a galaxy S5 to this because I liked having the ability to get a new battery when necessary in the S5.  So far so good and I couldn't ask for more from a cell phone.  It's has a super fast processor, great screen and so much more!  I'm still a little worried about the battery life a year from now but as it stands so far so good.Read full review...Verified purchase: No"

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."
"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."

Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time.

I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."
"Longer battery life than my previous phone, works great with the wireless chargerA very nice phone (previously had a S5 so a leap in technology ) Also works great with the wireless charger I purchased. If you don't have a wireless charger get one (if your phone is supports QI) because it makes life easier and doesn't destroy your USB connector. Longer battery life than my previous phone. Very good fingerprint scanner.

"Fabulous deviceGot the S8 for my wife and I love it more than my Note8.  I'm a big stylus user, so I stayed with the note.

"The Good, The Bad and Some NotesThe Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8\" may be a tad too big for one-handed use.

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."
"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen. As explicitly explained in the description, there is an image burned into the screen, but it really is barely noticeable (and usually only on a white or light page) and it very easy to get used to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."
"Longer battery life than my previous phone, works great with the wireless chargerA very nice phone (previously had a S5 so a leap in technology ) Also works great with the wireless charger I purchased. If you don't have a wireless charger get one (if your phone is supports QI) because it makes life easier and doesn't destroy your USB connector. Longer battery life than my previous phone.

"The Good, The Bad and Some NotesThe Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8\" may be a tad too big for one-handed use.

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."
"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen.

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."
"Longer battery life than my previous phone, works great with the wireless chargerA very nice phone (previously had a S5 so a leap in technology ) Also works great with the wireless charger I purchased. If you don't have a wireless charger get one (if your phone is supports QI) because it makes life easier and doesn't destroy your USB connector. Longer battery life than my previous phone.

"The Good, The Bad and Some NotesThe Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8\" may be a tad too big for one-handed use.

"Good upgrade from the S7, but almost as fragile as an iPhone.I upgraded my older Galaxy S7 to the S8.  I like the feature upgrades and additional functionalities that the S8 has added, along with the newer Andriod version that S8 supports.  Battery life seems to be good.  Took a little getting used to as the \"Home\" button is no longer a button, but a touch icon, and the figure print reader is on the back now.  Before with the S7 I could unlock just by touching my thumb to the home button, but now I have to do a two-finger action.  Just took a while to get the rhythm down.My only negative feedback is the S8 is FRAGILE!  Almost as bad as an iPhone! It slipped from my hand and fell about 1 foot, and shattered the screen.  I've dropped my S7 from 3-4 feet onto the same surface without a scratch.  After doing some research, I found that the S8 has a reputation for being one of the most fragile Samsung.  Don't know about the S9.  I had even purchased a SlimArmour case and a StinkLight screen protector, just hadn't put it on yet as I had just had the phone a little more than 2 - 3 hours.  It was $$ to repair.Overall, it's a good phone and an improvement over the S7.  Get a good case and screen protector and put it on pronto to avoid additional costs.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: salesatdistribu..."
"I love this phone!I'm very happy I took the leap and bought the Samsung Galaxy S8!  I had wanted the S8+, but now that I have the S8 I'm very happy with it.The screen is 5.8\", which is big enough, but there are no bezels so the actual size of the overall phone is not huge.  Makes it easier to put in my pocket and hold in one hand while typing.And as far as the 64 GB of storage, I'm not worried about it because it has an expandable SD card slot, so I can expand my storage another 256 GB!I was excited about the fingerprint scanner, but I actually use the bio-metric iris scanner.  Once registered, all I have to do is look at the phone and it unlocks, and yes, it works every time and is super fast.  It doesn't matter if it is sunny, or in my room at night in the dark, it works!Touch Wiz has been updated to something called \"Samsung Experience\" which is nice.  The S8 updated itself right out of the box.  Running Android 7.0 Nougat which is nice!  The headphones that come with the phone seem very premium.I can't say enough about the rear camera.  I also owned a phone with dual 13 mp rear facing cameras, that can't take a picture anywhere near as beautiful as the S8.  The sensors and software that Samsung uses for their cameras' can't be beat!The super AMOLED display has ruined me for life.  It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen.

It is so beautiful!Fast charge is nice, but the my only gripe is the battery life.  With very heavy use, I get about 6 hours with 15% left.  If I'm having a busy day, and not on my phone constantly, it will get me from 8 am to 10 pm with 10-15% battery left.The glass back is beautiful, and so are the curved bezel-less edges, which makes the phone slippery, and fair warning, they crack and break very easily.  I personally purchased a Rhino Shield bumper guard.  You can still appreciate the beauty of the phone, it is barely noticeable, with military grade protection.Rest assured, it is worth every penny!Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"
"Great deal, Great FunctionThis phone is a great deal. It feels and functions just like a brand new Galaxy s8. There were next to no scratches, and any were extremely minor and not on the screen. As explicitly explained in the description, there is an image burned into the screen, but it really is barely noticeable (and usually only on a white or light page) and it very easy to get used to. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice phone at a great price <U+0001F44D>. I would recommend a phone case, though, a little extra protection will make all the difference. The enclosed picture shows the image burn.Read full review...Product Reviews Images Dialog  Product Reviews Images DialogPrevious ImageNext ImageVerified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: yywirelesss"
"Great Phone!After having so many problems with LG phones, I decided to switch brands and find a new provider. This unlocked phone can work on any network. I just took mine to straight talk and got the bring your own phone activation kit, and was able to choose between any of the networks to set up my service. It works flawlessly so far! It comes with the necessary pieces to transfer photos, videos, contacts, emails, and more from your old device. It also came with a pair of headphones. I paired it with a ring case (a case with a built in rotating ring to relieve weight from the pinky) and it's the perfect fit for my small hands.The phone itself is amazing and has worked flawlessly so far. It has blue light filtering, one-handed mode, video enhancer, multi-window and more. The camera is stunning and it comes with tons of filter and stickers! I was able to re-download all of my old apps lightening fast on this new phone. After setting up the phone, downloading 30+ apps, using some apps, and tweaking the phone settings, I still have over half of the battery left.I would say this is the best phone purchase I have ever made, well worth the money.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: samsung"

"Nice phone for casual userMy husband bought the Galaxy S8 a couple weeks ago. This is a good phone. The display quality is nice. The phone is not very wide, so my husband gave it to me and bought the Galaxy note 8 which he really likes when he is texting. For me the width is not an issue while texting because I prefer smaller phones. The speaker is also noticably loud and clear. I recommend switching off the always on display if you don't need it because I think it drains the battery much faster and it seems unnecessary in my opinion. I don't use my phone for much other than phone calls, texting, watching YouTube, and browsing the internet.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: cellfeee"
"Great phone minus one advanced feature.This is a great phone in form and function. I don't have a problem with the rear finger reader like so many have. My biggest complaint is the Bixby button. It launches that app by accident to easily.<br>An oddity on my phone which is unlocked and will work on any network: for some odd reason it doesn't have advanced calling which contains HD voice and Wi-Fi calling. I've called Samsung and Verizon (I'm using them right now) and both say the other is responsible for putting that on so it's not going to happen for me.Spectacular screen, super fast and so pretty. Great camera. Battery life is pretty good. Not a perfect phone but the best I've had so far.No phone is worth $600 or even $500 unless you do insane high grahics gaming or other crazy things that need top scale graphics and speed. I've owned $170 dollar phones that did everything I need (web surfing, videos, texting, calling) just a bit slower and not as nice pictures so that's why I am putting not a good value.But I do enjoy cell phones so every once in a while I play the fool and pop for a flagship.Read full review..."
"Longer battery life than my previous phone, works great with the wireless chargerA very nice phone (previously had a S5 so a leap in technology ) Also works great with the wireless charger I purchased. If you don't have a wireless charger get one (if your phone is supports QI) because it makes life easier and doesn't destroy your USB connector. Longer battery life than my previous phone. Very good fingerprint scanner. Beautiful screenI would have given it 5 stars but couldn't bring myself to click \"Awesome Sauce\"Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: worldwirelessstar"
"Fabulous deviceGot the S8 for my wife and I love it more than my Note8.  I'm a big stylus user, so I stayed with the note.  This phone has a better design and the non + device has a large screen in a really easy to handle size.  Everything runs amazing.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: cellworksunlimited"
"The Good, The Bad and Some NotesThe Good- $899+ bucks worth of hardware for a relatively low price.- Top-grade technical specs.- Face recognition is nuts!- A really, really gorgeous design. Best phone design of 2017 (and 2018 too) IMHO.- Phone feels like it's going to last long, long time. Especially with the IP68 water and dust resistance certification.The Bad- Samsung UI still needs a bit of refinement.- Weird AF fingerprint sensor positioning. The sensor itself also needs some work.- Official Android updates take a little more time than I'd like to.Some Notes- 5.8\" may be a tad too big for one-handed use. A bit smaller would've resulted in the perfect smartphone size for my own preferences.Read full review...Verified purchase:  Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: jamesmauricebul..."
